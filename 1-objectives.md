# My First and Main App for 2026

**A TODO / Notekeeper**

---

## Why?

Important things are always happening:

- Things at job you have to remember
- Code you have to keep in mind
- You always forget something
- Same in your daily life:
  - Ideas
  - Things you start and forget
  - Things you start, continue, have hope in… and then forget

---

## This Is What Happens to Me

- I have a chat in Slack with myself and lots of messages.
  - Then I forget about 80% of them.
- I don’t have a clear view, and I don’t put everything in Jira.
- I create voice messages to remember large things, but for what?
  - I forget in the same way.

## Priorities

I have to add another one: **priorities**.  
My priorities in my day:

- Sport
- Read
- Walk or run
- Meet with friends
- My girl
- Enjoy my hobbies or create new ones

At the end: **organization**.

## The Goal

Something that will work **for you**, not you working for the app.

Something that will help you to keep your mind clean and healthy—not disturbed by lots of things.

This brings me to the **chaos**.  
Yes, I’m chaotic, and I don’t like it.

So I want to create something **for me**.  
Useful for me.  
Great for me.

**Vibe coding.**  
Piece by piece until having… a working software :)

*P.S. I’m not an English speaker, as you already (I’m sure) know.*

**Welcome to this journey.**
