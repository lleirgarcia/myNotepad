# My Notepad — Notes & TODO

A personal **TODO and notekeeper** app for 2026. One place to capture what matters: work, code, ideas, and life—without the noise.

## Purpose

Important things are always happening, and it’s easy to lose track:

- **Work:** Things at the job you have to remember  
- **Code:** Snippets and ideas you want to keep in mind  
- **Life:** Ideas, projects you start and forget, or start and then drop  

Scattered tools (Slack DMs to yourself, Jira, voice notes) don’t give a clear view and don’t stop the 80% from slipping away. This app is meant to fix that.

## What This App Is For

- **Notes** — Capture ideas, code, and longer thoughts in one place.  
- **TODOs** — Track tasks and follow-through.  
- **Priorities** — See and live by what matters: sport, reading, walking, friends, hobbies, and the rest.  
- **Organization** — A single, calm place instead of chaos across many apps.

The goal: **the app works for you**, not the other way around. It should help keep your mind clear and focused, not add more clutter.
